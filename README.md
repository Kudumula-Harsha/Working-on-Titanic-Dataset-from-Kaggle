# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a passenger was transported to another dimension during the Spaceship Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle competition **“Spaceship Titanic”** and involves binary classification based on passenger and travel information.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given a set of passenger features such as age, cabin details, expenses, and home planet, the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts:

- **Transported = True** → Passenger was transported  
- **Transported = False** → Passenger was not transported  

This is a **binary classification problem**.
